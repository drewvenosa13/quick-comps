# Quick Comps
This is a website meant to simplify making a comparable analysis table for companies in the S&P 500. 

The user is prompted to enter a ticker in the S&P 500 and then select from a list of that ticker's competitors. I pulled competitor info off Wiki: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies
and based it off the GICS Sub-Sector field.

Once they select from that list of tickers, they're able to download an Excel spreadsheet containing each company's: 
- Name
- Ticker
- MarketCap
- ForwardPE
- PEGRatio
- EV/EBITDA
- ROE-TTM
